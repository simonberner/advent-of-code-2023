# âœ¨ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2023 ðŸŽ„âœ¨
The original puzzle of the year is back! This time I tried to tackle it in JavaScript.

## Website
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

## Solutions
In this repository you can find my solutions for the puzzles. Each day's solution is located in its own directory.

In each directory you will find:

- `README.md`: the puzzle description
- `input.txt`: my puzzle input; to use your own input text from the puzzle, you can copy/paste it in this file
- `index.js`: my solution
- `index.test.js`: tests for part 1 and part 2 of the puzzle, using the example in the description

You can use `npm start <day>` to get the solutions for that day; e.g. `npm start 01` to get the first day.
